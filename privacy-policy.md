# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Wick's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, https://wickdev.xyz , and other sites we own and operate.

## Information We Collect

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Wick collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Wick's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Wick's visitors use its website.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Wick's websites choose to interact with Wick in ways that require Wick to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Wick gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://wickdev.xyz to provide a username and email address.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links To External Sites

Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites, products, or services.

## Aggregated Statistics

## Cookies

To enrich and perfect your online experience, Wick uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
